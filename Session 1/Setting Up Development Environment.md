## Step 1: Verify Python is installed
```
python --version
```
## Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment
```
python -m venv venv
```
## Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment
```
venv\Scripts\activate
```
> Note: This command needs to be run every time we start a new terminal instance in order to have access to all the packages we will install later.
## Step 4: Install Flask

pip install flask
```
