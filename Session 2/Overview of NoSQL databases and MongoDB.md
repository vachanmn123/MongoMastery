1. **Introduction to NoSQL Databases**
   - **Definition**: NoSQL stands for "Not Only SQL." These databases are designed to handle large volumes of **unstructured** or **semi-structured data**.
   - **Types**: Includes document stores (e.g., MongoDB), key-value stores (e.g., Redis), column-family stores (e.g., Cassandra), and graph databases (e.g., Neo4j).
   - **Flexibility**: Unlike relational databases, NoSQL databases **do not require a fixed schema,** making them ideal for evolving data models.

2. **Advantages of NoSQL Databases**
   - **Scalability**: Easily scales horizontally by distributing data across multiple servers.
   - **Performance**: Optimised for high performance, especially for read and write operations on large datasets.
   - **Schema-less**: Allows for flexible and dynamic data models.
   - **Variety of Data**: Can handle different types of data, including JSON, XML, and other formats.

3. **Introduction to MongoDB**
   - **Document-Oriented**: Stores data in flexible, **JSON-like documents (BSON format)**.
   - **Schema Flexibility**: Documents in a collection can have different fields, allowing for easy updates to the data structure.
   - **Rich Query Language**: Supports a powerful query language with features like indexing, aggregation, and geospatial queries.
   - **High Availability**: Provides replication and sharding for high availability and horizontal scalability.

4. **Key Features of MongoDB**
   - **Document Model**: **Documents are self-descriptive**, making it easier to understand the data.
   - **Indexing**: Supports various types of **indexes to improve query performance**.
   - **Aggregation Framework**: Powerful tool for **data aggregation and transformation**.
   - **Replication**: Ensures data redundancy and increases data availability through replica sets.
   - **Sharding**: Distributes data **across multiple servers to handle large datasets** and provide horizontal scalability.

5. **When to Use MongoDB**
   - **Dynamic Schema**: Ideal for applications where the **data structure is evolving**.
   - **Big Data**: Suitable for handling **large volumes of data that require quick access**.
   - **Real-Time Analytics**: Perfect for **applications needing real-time data processing and analysis**.
   - **Content Management**: Well-suited for content management systems, catalogs, and event logging.

6. **Popular Use Cases for MongoDB**
   - **E-commerce**: Product catalogs with varying attributes.
   - **Content Management**: Blogs, websites, and CMS platforms.
   - **Real-Time Analytics**: Monitoring and analyzing data in real-time.
   - **IoT**: Managing data from interconnected devices.
